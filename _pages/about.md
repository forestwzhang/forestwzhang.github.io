I am currently a research assistant working with Ke Wu at the University of Michigan. My research interests lie at intersection between ***theoretical computer science*** and ***game theory***, particularly ***mechanism design***.

I recently completed my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Michigan College of Engineering, where I worked with Ke Wu and Greg Bodwin.

My CV is available [here](/assets/pdf/Forest_Zhang_CV.pdf).
